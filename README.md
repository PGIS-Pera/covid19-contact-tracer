# Covid19 Contact Tracer

Covid 19 has become a global pandemic since late 2019. Matter of fact Sri Lanka became a severe victim of the pandemic
due to aggressively spreading different variants. Prevention is the only option remaining for Sri Lankans as the country
exceeds all the healthcare thresholds by now. Currently the main challenge faced by both the healthcare officials and
the citizens is to trace the positive people and convey the locations they visited in the last two weeks with other
potential contacts.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), contact tracing is the process of identifying all people that a
COVID-19 person has come in contact with in the last two weeks [1]. It has been an impossible task for an infected
person to remember all the locations he/she visited in the last two weeks, which leads to a complex contact tracing
process. As a result of that, an infected person may spread the virus in the community . Furthermore, accessing or
tracing personal records of a citizen is prevented and covered under the legislation of each county and protected by
privacy policies of the same. Therefore, no authority can force a person to reveal his/her travelling history without a
proper legal procedure. It has completely become the accountability of every citizen of a community to be self-aware
about individuals' health and safety while taking the responsibility to prevent spreading the deadly virus in the
society.

The main intention behind the proposed “Covid19 Contact Tracer” is to assist people to keep track of their own routing
history and help healthcare officials to manage the positive cases and notify their close-contacts more effectively,
efficiently and reliably.
